    <li>½ cup white sugar, or more to taste</li>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.    </li>
    <li>Combine egg whites and rose petal powder in the bowl of a stand mixer; beat until soft peaks form. Start beating in 1/2 cup sugar gradually. Increase speed to high and beat until stiff and glossy peaks form. Mix in vanilla extract and rose extract. Fold cornstarch very gently into the meringue using a spatula.    </li>
    <li>Spoon meringue into a piping bag fitted with a fine round tip. Pipe into 18 individual rounds.    </li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until edges appear dry, 1 hour 15 minutes. Turn off oven and leave pavlovas inside the oven for another 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool completely, about 30 minutes.    </li>
    <li>Beat cream cheese in a bowl for 30 seconds. Add heavy cream and 2 tablespoons sugar; beat until fluffy. Spoon whipped cream into another piping bag.    </li>
    <li>Pipe whipped cream over cooled pavlovas. Decorate with dried rose petals.    </li>
