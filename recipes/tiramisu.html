    <li>1 ¼ cups Marsala wine</li>
    <li>4 medium eggs, separated</li>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Mix cooled coffee and Marsala wine together in a bowl.</li>
    <li>Beat egg yolks with half of the sugar in a bowl until you have a clear cream with no lumps. Stir the mascarpone with a wooden spoon or whisk in a separate bowl until creamy; stir into the egg yolks.</li>
    <li>Beat the egg whites with the remaining sugar in a separate bowl using an electric mixer until they form peaks; fold gently into mascarpone mixture.</li>
    <li>Dip half of the savoiardi biscuits into coffee-Marsala mixture. Arrange dipped biscuits carefully in a glass dish. Cover dipped biscuits with half of the mascarpone mixture. Smooth out mascarpone until evenly distributed; top with half of the cocoa powder. Repeat layering with dipped savoiardi biscuits, mascarpone mixture, and cocoa powder; top with chocolate shavings.</li>
    <li>Refrigerate tiramisu until flavors blend, at least 3 hours.</li>
